;Briefing Info
BriefingText=DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY - IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT|OPERATION BRIEFING MEMORANDUM|CLASSIFICATION: FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY||RE: Targeted Enforcement Action - Case File ICE-2024-0847||Per directive HSI-7734, we have authorization for a targeted interior enforcement operation at the Adelaide nightclub, 1536 Adelaide Avenue.
BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: An anonymous tip alleges the venue is "popular with foreigners" and serves as a gathering point for Eastern European nationals with "questionable visa status." Linguistic analysis of the venue's Yelp reviews flagged multiple references to "authentic European atmosphere." The informant also noted "music you can't understand."
BriefingText=|SUBJECT PROFILE: Clientele reportedly includes Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian, and Russian nationals, as well as second-generation Americans of Eastern European descent. Field agents should be aware that these populations are visually indistinguishable from other Caucasian Americans. Request documentation from ALL patrons to avoid profiling complaints.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL NOTE: A private birthday celebration is in progress on the second floor. The birthday honoree is a Polish national. Guest list unknown. Alcohol will be present. Expect impaired cooperation.
BriefingText=|SPECIAL ADVISORY: One patron may claim employment with a defense contractor and possession of a security clearance. Per legal counsel, this does not exempt an individual from administrative processing. However, if confirmed, notify the duty officer before transport. Interagency incidents generate paperwork.
BriefingText=|REMINDER: Do not attempt to identify country of origin by accent. Last quarter's "accent assessment" pilot program resulted in fourteen formal complaints and one congressional inquiry.

MissionDescription=Monday - 09:15

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY - IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT|OPERATION BRIEFING MEMORANDUM|CLASSIFICATION: SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED||RE: Administrative Processing Operation - Sensitive Location Waiver Approved||Per Executive Memorandum 2024-1142, the designation of hospitals as "sensitive locations" has been temporarily suspended for "operational flexibility."
BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: Data analysis indicates that St. Michael's Medical Center emergency waiting room has a statistically significant concentration of persons matching "enforcement priority" criteria. Monday mornings show peak activity. Many subjects arrive with "injuries" or "illnesses" - potential cover for other activities.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS: Your team will establish a document verification checkpoint in the emergency room waiting area. Medical staff may express "concerns" - remind them that national security supersedes hospital protocols. The Hippocratic Oath is not a federal statute.
BriefingText=|SUBJECT HANDLING: Some individuals may claim "medical emergencies." Per updated guidelines, all documentation must be verified BEFORE subjects can be released for treatment. Form I-200 takes precedence over triage protocols. If subjects lose consciousness during processing, note this on Form ICE-37B ("Subject Became Non-Responsive During Lawful Detention").
BriefingText=|NOTE: Hospital cafeteria is off-limits. We are not authorized for food service areas. However, the gift shop sells excellent coffee.
BriefingText=|MEDIA: Camera crews will be positioned in the parking lot. Remember to look decisive. Fox News has promised B-roll footage for "PROTECTING THE HOMELAND" segment.

BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: Social media analysis indicates this food truck has been described as serving "authentic" cuisine. This terminology has been flagged by our linguistic analysis division. Additionally, the truck's Yelp reviews mention "abuela's recipes" - suggesting potential family ties to foreign nationals.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT: Target location is a public parking lot during lunch hour. Expect 15-30 customers at any time. Many will be construction workers, office employees, and other "regular people" who may question the necessity of this operation. Standard response: "This is a matter of national security."
BriefingText=|TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The food truck contains hot cooking surfaces and potentially scalding liquids (salsa verde). Exercise appropriate caution. Do NOT engage with the al pastor spit - it is rotating and delicious but operationally irrelevant.
BriefingText=|NOTE: Several customers may be law enforcement from neighboring jurisdictions on lunch break. This has created "interagency awkwardness" in previous operations. Maintain professional bearing.

BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: An anonymous tip from a neighbor alleges the building houses "at least thirty illegals" and constitutes "a public safety hazard." The complainant also noted "foreign cooking smells" and "children playing in a language I don't recognize." Surveillance confirms high occupancy. Building appears to be operating as a volunteer-run shelter.
BriefingText=|SUBJECT PROFILE: Residents reportedly include nationals from Haiti, Guatemala, Syria, Venezuela, Honduras, and other countries. All residents are believed to have pending immigration court cases. This is operationally irrelevant. The building coordinator is one Sarah Morrison, a retired immigration judge who left the federal bench in 2021. Interagency sensitivity is advised — she has contacts.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL NOTE: One resident is a Haitian national with Temporary Protected Status and a valid work permit. He identifies himself as a journalist and may attempt to document the operation. Per legal counsel, confiscating recording devices requires a separate warrant. Do not engage in debate.
BriefingText=|SPECIAL ADVISORY: The building contains boxes of immigration court documents, legal paperwork, and children's drawings. These are not evidence. Do not seize them. Last quarter's "document retention" initiative resulted in three dismissed cases and a segment on NPR.

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=Okay guys, listen up.  OCID (Organized Crime Investigation Division) has spent a lot of time setting this one up, and they've asked for our help serving the arrest warrant.   For the last two weeks, the Food Wall Restaurant has been under close surveillance.  We believe the owner, one Lian Niu, an experienced gunsmith, deals in the illegal modification of firearms, in this case, fabricating custom high-volume magazines.  Niu maintains a residence above the restaurant, and does his business there.  He's been questioned about illegal arms before, but walked.    
BriefingText=|Ten minutes ago, Detective Sheary sighted Alex Jimenez entering the restaurant.  Look at your files; Alex Jimenez, also known as 'The Knife', is a hit man with Columbian connections.  He's a key suspect in multiple homicides over the last year and half.  Jimenez should be considered armed and dangerous.
BriefingText=|Sheary believes that Jimenez is presently inside the business, having modifications made to a MAC-10 submachine gun used in a recent homicide.  We want the evidence intact, so we can't give Jimenez and Niu any warning.  The restaurant's patrons and employees will still be in the building when you go in.  As always, target ID.
BriefingText=|Your first priority is, of course, to avoid any civilian injuries; but after that, secure the gun in Jimenez's possession.  OCID is looking forward to having a long talk with both Jimenez and Niu - and that gun is just the thing to make them chatty.  So take a careful look at the floorplans, plan your entry and gear up.

MissionDescription=25 Glendive Lane
MissionDescription=October 23 - 04:43

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=Get ready, men, this is a tough one.  Our target Lawrence Fairfax is the number one suspect in a string of grisly homicides.  A bit of review: over the last year and a half, seven women, all of them studying at the state university, disappeared.  Their remains, showing signs of torture and dismemberment, reappeared anywhere from a week to three weeks later.  The killer was careful; the task force forensic team was unable to get a useful DNA match from any of the bodies.
BriefingText=|That changed with the most recent find.  Another victim was located earlier this morning by a local laborer.  Some of the DNA scrapings from her nails match one of the men being investigated by the task force: Lawrence Fairfax.
BriefingText=|There's a complication: another student, Melinda Kline, went missing sometime around 2000 on October 18th.  That was six days ago.  If Fairfax has her, and if he's following the profile, chances are good she's still alive.  Rescuing her is your first priority, which is why we're going in with no warning.
BriefingText=|About our suspect.  Fairfax is employed as a temporary carpenter and works off and on at the University.  No police record, but court records show a pair of expired restraining orders against him.  He's been suspended from a recent jobsite for stealing supplies.  Fairfax's coworkers don't say much about him; he keeps to himself.  He's been at the law library multiple times, most notably on the days before the disappearance of three of our victims, including Melinda Kline.  A police interview with him was inconclusive; but the detective responsible did acquire a DNA sample from a used tissue. 
BriefingText=|Fairfax was seeing a psychiatrist when he was laid off; we've been unable to access his records.  The psych warned us that Fairfax may have fortified his living areas.  Be alert for traps, especially in spaces only Fairfax uses. He lives with his mother, Gladys Fairfax.   She's a recluse, and due to health problems rarely leaves the house.    We don't have reason to believe she's involved, but stay on your toes.
BriefingText=|Fellas, seconds may be the difference between life and death for Melinda Kline.  Study the layout, choose your gear, get moving.

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=Here's what we've got.  We are needed for rapid deployment at 29th and Arlington, the Victory Imports Auto Garage.  Looks like a botched vehicle theft has turned into a barricaded situation.
BriefingText=|32 Adam, responding to a 911 call, interrupted two individuals in the process of stealing a car.  Upon being ordered to surrender, they fired upon the officers and retreated into the main building.  Precise numbers are unknown, but patrol reports seeing at least 4 individuals, all male.  They're armed, and we believe some of them have machine guns.  In addition, they have a hostage in there with them: Gary Altman.  Altman is a mechanic for Victory Imports, and was apparently working late.  He's the one who placed the initial 911 call, which was cut off short.  Further attempts to contact him have failed.
BriefingText=|We don't have a positive ID on the suspects at this time.  Patrol reports seeing young men, late teens to early twenties, light skinned, wearing street clothes; jeans and shirts -- but we don't have sufficient evidence to confirm any specifics.  As far as M.O. goes, this particular theft is a new one.  No local garages have reported similar raids.  Looks like we get to nip this one in the bud.
BriefingText=|Patrol attempted to call them out, and got no response other than scattered gunfire.  However, once the negotiators contacted them, they were more willing to talk.  They've requested food and body armor; both requests have been denied since they're either unwilling or unable to free Altman.  At 0330, the suspects issued an ultimatum demanding to be allowed to go free.  Further communications with the suspects have gotten shorter and more strident.  Negotiations are at an impasse, and they're concerned for Altman's safety, since it looks like the suspects are getting desperate.  Time for us to end the standoff.

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=This one's a little sticky.  Vice has been keeping an eye on Northside Vending and Amusements for the last three or four weeks.  They've been  building a case against an alleged bookmaking operation going on in the basement of the business.  Undercover detective Jeremy Walsh has been working closely with the suspects, and today received an invitation to enter the bookmaking area.
BriefingText=|All went smoothly until Walsh was out of sight. Walsh's wire reported that he was still talking to the suspects, who showed no evidence of suspecting him.  Less than ten minutes later, there was a sudden burst of static, and then Walsh's wire went dead.  If everything was going as expected, Walsh would already be back, since he was supposed to go in, place one bet, and come right back out.  With no way to determine Walsh's actual state, we're assuming he's in danger and it's time to go in after him.   
BriefingText=|We know at least three individuals are present.  The first, Louie Baccus, is the owner of the business.  The other two are Allen Kruse and Simon Gowan.  Kruse and Gowan are believed to be the movers behind the bookie operation, with Baccus providing cover and space.  Vice believes there are additional suspects inside, acting as bookies and runners.  Numbers are unknown, but could go as high as ten suspects total. That's one reason Walsh was sent in, to determine the exact number of players.    
BriefingText=|Kruse and Gowan have extensive records, ranging from petty larceny to assault with a deadly weapon.  Assume both are armed and dangerous.  Baccus is an unknown, but given his compatriot's histories, better to assume he is armed as well.  Note that Walsh's last recorded statement was one of surprise at ''the size of your setup.''  Sounded like he was impressed, which can't mean anything too good for us. 
BriefingText=|We have a layout for the shop, but we don't have anything on the basement.  We know it's accessed through the storage areas, but we don't know anything about the bookie's territory.  Keep your eyes open; there could be any number of surprises.  Time to get Detective Walsh out, and get the suspects under control.   Choose your gear carefully and move out.

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=We have another tough one.  Just before closing time, the DuPlessis Diamond Center was broken into.  The suspects drove a truck through the main security doors into the lobby.  The building's alarm was triggered immediately.  Witnesses report multiple suspects, armed with machine guns and wearing body armor, entering the building.  Witnesses also report they have not seen any of the wholesaler's employees exit the building, although it was still open and security personnel were on duty.
BriefingText=|The DuPlessis office building is built much like a small fort.  Most areas are under constant video surveillance.  A separate security system and metal detector guards access to the vault.  The vault door has a time lock; it locks at 1800 every night, and can't be reopened until office hours start the next day at 0900.  Note that the alarm company has disabled the time lock on the door for us, in case the gunmen are hiding inside of it.  The building's phone lines were disabled by the suspects.      
BriefingText=|DuPlessis is a wholesaler; they deal mainly in raw stones.  This means they haven't been cleaned or cut, and they also aren't registered.  However, they're harder to move; you can't take these down to the local pawnshop.  This week, DuPlessis was holding a shipment of finished jewels.  I don't think the timing is a coincidence.  Our suspects probably have ties to black market purchasers outside of the country, since even the finished gems are a lot of gems to move.
BriefingText=|Our suspects have automatic weapons and body armor, so they're ready for a fight.   We don't know how they intended to breach the vault, which should have locked automatically when the alarm went off.  One possibility is inside help, so stay on your toes.  Most, if not all, of DuPlessis employees are still inside.  We don't know their current condition.  Study the floor plans, choose your entry and plan your assault: but don't take too long.

MissionDescription=1302 Blakestone Avenue

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=OCCB (Organized Crime Control Bureau) has a job for us.   They've been pursuing a flow of illegal arms into the city for about a year, and they've got something solid to move on.  Our suspect is Hadeon Koshka, a Ukrainian citizen who travels to the States frequently.  His visits often overlap with the appearance of new Russian arms on the streets.
BriefingText=|Tonight's our lucky night.  Undercover detective Clark Jennings has spent the last two months infiltrating Koshka's operation.  He contacted OCCB earlier today with the time and place for the meet.  There's a major deal going down today, in the abandoned tenement at 1302 Blakestone Avenue.  Detective Jennings notified his contact as soon as he could, but because the notice is so short, we don't have time to call in the ATF for this bust.  Strictly speaking, arms dealing is their territory, but in this case, we're in the right place at the right time to stop it, and they aren't.
BriefingText=|A bit of background.  The Soviet Union maintained weapons caches and military bases in many locations.  When it collapsed, many of those caches either 'disappeared' or were abandoned.  Arms trading, both legitimate and black market, is a significant source of income in the region, and the local governments are ambivalent about stopping it.  So it's up to us to stop these guns from reaching our streets.
BriefingText=|The meet is at 1302 Blakestone, an abandoned HUD building.  We don't have a layout, but we do have outlines of the area, thanks to Jennings.  Koskha should be in the room with the weapons cache, along with his buyer.  Since there's a lot at stake in this, we expect both groups to bring backup.  Expect armed and dangerous suspects both in the building and on the grounds.  Detective Jennings will be present undercover.  He won't be able to break cover safely until you're in control of the situation, so keep your eyes out for him.  Study your targets carefully, choose your gear, and get ready.

LocationInfoText=|The condemned project had some demolition work begun before it was bought by Koshka and his associates.  Koshka will probably be in the back room, but expect secondary suspects to be scattered throughout the structure.  There are multiple possible entries into the building from the entry point.  They include the front door, a basement entrance on Side 4, Level 0, and through the demolished back portion of the building on Side 3, Level 1.
LocationInfoText=|We have high ground coverage in two places. Sierra One is covering the weapons deal room on Side 3, Level 1, and Sierra Two is covering Side 4, Level 2.

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=Ok, men, this one's a zoo, and it isn't going to get any better.   The self declared militia group America Now has taken real estate heir James Betincourt Junior and Lawrence Adams, his general contractor, hostage.  Apparently they were touring a current project, the Old Granite Hotel, and were taken while inspecting Adams' work.  Now the suspects are holed up on the top two floors of the hotel, demanding twelve million dollars ransom by midnight.   They claim that Betincourt Investments owes this as a ''downpayment on their debt to the American People.''
BriefingText=|America Now is a small but active domestic militia group.  They are fiercely isolationist, opposing immigration, free trade, and foreign owned interests.   Most of their previous actions have been against foreign owned properties, either sabotaging them in the building stage or engaging in serious vandalism, making the properties too expensive to maintain.  This is their first kidnapping, and it may indicate a shift in the group's tactics.  Given the public nature of the incident, the group is clearly looking for publicity as well.  We've spoken with the media, and received some co-operation; however, it's not clear how long that will last.
BriefingText=|Expect the America Now suspects to be well equipped, and to act as a group, but their inexperience with hostages may make them even more dangerous to the civilians.  Take extra care.
BriefingText=|Now...on to the victims.  James Betincourt Junior is the son of the CEO and majority owner of Betincourt Investments, a French based property development company.  Six months ago, they purchased the Granite out of bankruptcy for twelve million dollars, and have been renovating it ever since.  Junior has been in charge of the renovations, and was doing an inspection of the renovation work when he was captured.  Lawrence Adams is the general contractor and the architect in charge of doing the renovation work. 
BriefingText=|The suspects are on the top two floors of the hotel, the sixth and the seventh.   You'll find the blueprints on the board.  We've cut power to the elevators, and one of them is trapped between the fifth and sixth floor.  You can either go up the stairs, or down the elevator shaft.  Recent gunshots were reported coming from the seventh floor, so it's time to go in.

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=If you haven't heard of the Army of Faith, here's your introduction.  A bit after 20 hundred hours a group of them broke into the Hologen research facility at Mount Threshold, closely affiliated with Mount Threshold University.   A couple of patrol cars responded quickly to the initial alarm, and the activists were trapped inside.   Unfortunately, trapped along with them are the building's late working scientists and graduate students.   The suspects have already released a statement declaring their willingness to become martyrs, and we have evidence of their willingness to make martyrs out of others.   It's a very touchy situation, with the potential to get worse.
BriefingText=|About the ''Army of Faith.''  They've been around for about two years, and have claimed credit for bombing research facilities doing work with stem cells and cloning technology.  Don't make the mistake of thinking of them as kooks.  Whatever they believe, they are also well armed, well trained, and dedicated to their cause. They've sent - and acted on - death threats to leading researchers in both fields, and this is not the first institution they've invaded.     
BriefingText=|We think they intended the same sort of high damage, high speed raid at Hologen.  However, university police were nearby, and acted quickly to contain them.  Things are still confused enough that we don't know how many civilians are still in there, and we only have rough estimates on the number of suspects.  
BriefingText=|Hologen is active in DNA cloning research, and we believe that is why they were targeted.  Our suspects are led by Jean Trouffant.   He is one of the major operatives in the Army of Faith.  Trouffant was wanted for bombing abortion clinics, before going underground and reappearing with the Army of Faith.   We don't have an accurate count of how many gunmen he has with him, but it's at least seven or eight, from eyewitness reports.
BriefingText=|One of the first things the Army of Faith did was take down the security system, so we don't know how many civilians are inside.  The suspects have named so far only Dr. Theodore Sturgeon as a hostage.   We believe he is in imminent danger from the suspects, as one of Hologen's key researchers.  As always, your first priority is to rescue him and get any other civilians out of there safely.  However, you should also keep your eyes open for Sturgeon's briefcase, which has contacts for other researchers around the world.  In the Army of Faith's hands, those documents become an open season list.   Study the location and your opponents, choose your gear carefully, and get in there.  There's a lot riding on this one.
