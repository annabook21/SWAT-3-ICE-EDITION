;ChyronText="BREAKING: KEEPING AMERICA SAFE | ICE agents move on suspected gathering | Sources: 'Large crowd, loud music' | DEVELOPING STORY"
;AnchorVO="And we're seeing agents moving in now on what appears to be... some kind of celebration? Our sources describe it as a 'cultural event.' Back to you, Tucker."

[NewsEntry_Hospital]
;ChyronText="ALERT: PROTECTING THE HOMELAND | Enforcement action at local hospital | Critics: 'Unprecedented' | Officials: 'Necessary'"
;AnchorVO="This is unprecedented access, folks. You're watching history. These brave agents are doing what needs to be done. The waiting room appears to be... mostly women and children. But that's exactly what they'd want you to think."

[NewsEntry_School]
;ChyronText="EXCLUSIVE: OPERATION TINY FOOTPRINTS | School event becomes enforcement opportunity | Left outraged | Patriots applaud"
;AnchorVO="Now, the mainstream media will tell you this is a 'school play.' But what they won't tell you is that some of these parents may not have their paperwork in order. Intermission is beginning. Here we go."

[NewsEntry_TacoTruck]
;ChyronText="LIVE: LUNCH RUSH ENFORCEMENT | Mobile food vendor targeted | 'Authentic' cuisine raises flags | WATCH LIVE"
;AnchorVO="We're told the tacos here are... quote... 'authentic.' Now, what does that mean exactly? Our experts will weigh in. But first, agents are approaching the service window..."

; DEBRIEF DIALOGUE
; (Political leadership congratulates regardless of outcome)
;-----------------

[Debrief_Success]
;Text="Outstanding work out there. The Director is very pleased with our numbers. We processed [X] individuals today - that's going to look great in the quarterly report. Now, some people might say we 'disrupted a birthday party' or 'prevented sick people from seeing doctors.' But we know what we really did: we enforced the law. And that's what matters. Fox wants a soundbite for the 6 o'clock. Something about 'protecting American families.' The irony is... well, let's not dwell on that. Dismissed."

[Debrief_Failure]
;Text="So... that didn't go exactly as planned. But here's the thing: we showed up. We made our presence known. And that sends a message. Sure, the footage isn't... ideal. Legal is already working on the statement. The key phrase is 'regrettable but necessary.' Now, the Director still wants to do the press conference. We'll focus on the numbers - we always focus on the numbers. Remember: you did your jobs. If anyone asks, this was a success. Because we say it was. Dismissed."

[Debrief_Political]
;Text="Let me be clear: this administration will not apologize for enforcing the law. Were there children present? Yes. Were some of them crying? I'm told yes. But you know who else cries? American children. American children whose parents... well, we're still working on that talking point. The bottom line is this: we made the news. And in this business, that's what counts. Now, who wants to be in the photo op?"
