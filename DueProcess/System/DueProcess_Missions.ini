;Briefing Info
BriefingText=DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY - IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT|OPERATION BRIEFING MEMORANDUM|CLASSIFICATION: FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY||RE: Targeted Enforcement Action - Case File ICE-2024-0847||Per directive HSI-7734, we have authorization for a targeted interior enforcement operation at the Adelaide nightclub, 1536 Adelaide Avenue.
BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: An anonymous tip alleges the venue is "popular with foreigners" and serves as a gathering point for Eastern European nationals with "questionable visa status." Linguistic analysis of the venue's Yelp reviews flagged multiple references to "authentic European atmosphere." The informant also noted "music you can't understand."
BriefingText=|SUBJECT PROFILE: Clientele reportedly includes Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian, and Russian nationals, as well as second-generation Americans of Eastern European descent. Field agents should be aware that these populations are visually indistinguishable from other Caucasian Americans. Request documentation from ALL patrons to avoid profiling complaints.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL NOTE: A private birthday celebration is in progress on the second floor. The birthday honoree is a Polish national. Guest list unknown. Alcohol will be present. Expect impaired cooperation.
BriefingText=|SPECIAL ADVISORY: One patron may claim employment with a defense contractor and possession of a security clearance. Per legal counsel, this does not exempt an individual from administrative processing. However, if confirmed, notify the duty officer before transport. Interagency incidents generate paperwork.
BriefingText=|REMINDER: Do not attempt to identify country of origin by accent. Last quarter's "accent assessment" pilot program resulted in fourteen formal complaints and one congressional inquiry.

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY - IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT|OPERATION BRIEFING MEMORANDUM|CLASSIFICATION: SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED||RE: Administrative Processing Operation - Sensitive Location Waiver Approved||Per Executive Memorandum 2024-1142, the designation of hospitals as "sensitive locations" has been temporarily suspended for "operational flexibility."
BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: Data analysis indicates that St. Michael's Medical Center emergency waiting room has a statistically significant concentration of persons matching "enforcement priority" criteria. Monday mornings show peak activity. Many subjects arrive with "injuries" or "illnesses" - potential cover for other activities.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS: Your team will establish a document verification checkpoint in the emergency room waiting area. Medical staff may express "concerns" - remind them that national security supersedes hospital protocols. The Hippocratic Oath is not a federal statute.
BriefingText=|SUBJECT HANDLING: Some individuals may claim "medical emergencies." Per updated guidelines, all documentation must be verified BEFORE subjects can be released for treatment. Form I-200 takes precedence over triage protocols. If subjects lose consciousness during processing, note this on Form ICE-37B ("Subject Became Non-Responsive During Lawful Detention").
BriefingText=|NOTE: Hospital cafeteria is off-limits. We are not authorized for food service areas. However, the gift shop sells excellent coffee.
BriefingText=|MEDIA: Camera crews will be positioned in the parking lot. Remember to look decisive. Fox News has promised B-roll footage for "PROTECTING THE HOMELAND" segment.

BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: Lincoln Elementary School is hosting its annual spring play. Intelligence indicates high concentration of family units. Target environment: school auditorium during performance of "The Wizard of Oz" by third-grade class.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL NOTE: Children may become distressed. Per updated guidance, this is the responsibility of accompanying adults. Remind subjects that family separation is a "consequence of their choices." If children ask questions, refer them to the school counselor (Note: verify counselor documentation first).
BriefingText=|TIMING: Operation will commence during intermission to minimize disruption to the performance. Command has determined that allowing children to complete "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" is operationally acceptable.
BriefingText=|SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: The child playing Dorothy has been identified as a U.S. citizen. Her parents have not. Do not engage with the ruby slippers - they are theatrical props.

BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: Social media analysis indicates this food truck has been described as serving "authentic" cuisine. This terminology has been flagged by our linguistic analysis division. Additionally, the truck's Yelp reviews mention "abuela's recipes" - suggesting potential family ties to foreign nationals.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT: Target location is a public parking lot during lunch hour. Expect 15-30 customers at any time. Many will be construction workers, office employees, and other "regular people" who may question the necessity of this operation. Standard response: "This is a matter of national security."
BriefingText=|TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The food truck contains hot cooking surfaces and potentially scalding liquids (salsa verde). Exercise appropriate caution. Do NOT engage with the al pastor spit - it is rotating and delicious but operationally irrelevant.
BriefingText=|NOTE: Several customers may be law enforcement from neighboring jurisdictions on lunch break. This has created "interagency awkwardness" in previous operations. Maintain professional bearing.

BriefingText=DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY - IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT|OPERATION BRIEFING MEMORANDUM|CLASSIFICATION: FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY||RE: Residential Compliance Initiative - Case File ICE-2024-1293||Per directive HSI-8891, we have authorization for a residential interior enforcement operation at 2189 Carrols Road, a three-story tenement building operating as an informal shelter for asylum seekers.
BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: An anonymous tip from a neighbor alleges the building houses "at least thirty illegals" and constitutes "a public safety hazard." The complainant also noted "foreign cooking smells" and "children playing in a language I don't recognize." Surveillance confirms high occupancy. Building appears to be operating as a volunteer-run shelter.
BriefingText=|SUBJECT PROFILE: Residents reportedly include nationals from Haiti, Guatemala, Syria, Venezuela, Honduras, and other countries. All residents are believed to have pending immigration court cases. This is operationally irrelevant. The building coordinator is one Sarah Morrison, a retired immigration judge who left the federal bench in 2021. Interagency sensitivity is advised — she has contacts.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL NOTE: One resident is a Haitian national with Temporary Protected Status and a valid work permit. He identifies himself as a journalist and may attempt to document the operation. Per legal counsel, confiscating recording devices requires a separate warrant. Do not engage in debate.
BriefingText=|SPECIAL ADVISORY: The building contains boxes of immigration court documents, legal paperwork, and children's drawings. These are not evidence. Do not seize them. Last quarter's "document retention" initiative resulted in three dismissed cases and a segment on NPR.
BriefingText=|REMINDER: All residents have pending court dates. This means they are in the system. They showed up. They are waiting. This does not affect your operational parameters.

;Suspects
SuspectName=Non-Compliant Individuals
SuspectVitals=Pending Form I-200 processing
SuspectDescription=Any resident who does not immediately comply with processing. Note: Hiding children behind you is classified as "obstruction" per updated guidelines. Crying is not non-compliance, though it may feel that way. Reports of weapons in the building have not been verified but justify the tactical approach.
