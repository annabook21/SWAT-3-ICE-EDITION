BriefingText=DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY - IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT|OPERATION BRIEFING MEMORANDUM|CLASSIFICATION: FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY||RE: Targeted Enforcement Action - Case File ICE-2024-0847||Gentlemen, per directive HSI-7734 subsection C, we have been authorized to conduct a targeted interior enforcement operation at the Adelaide Community Center.
BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: Social media monitoring has identified a "large gathering of persons of interest" at this location. Facial recognition cross-referenced with the Suspicious Activity Reporting database returned seventeen potential matches. Field verification is required.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL NOTE: Upon arrival, you may observe what appears to be a cultural celebration. Per the Memorandum of Understanding with local law enforcement, this is classified as a "community event of enforcement interest." Intelligence indicates the presence of: (1) A young female in formal attire, (2) Multiple adult males in matching suits, (3) Amplified music exceeding municipal noise ordinances.
BriefingText=|PRIMARY MISSION PARAMETERS: Secure all persons present for administrative processing. Collect and catalog all documentation. Note that many subjects may claim to be "family members" - this is a common obfuscation tactic. All claims must be verified via Form I-200 before release can be considered.
BriefingText=|MEDIA ADVISORY: Fox affiliate WXBR has requested embedded access for their "KEEPING AMERICA SAFE" segment. Maintain professional bearing. Remember: you are the thin blue line between order and... whatever this is.
BriefingText=|REMINDER: Per updated use-of-force guidelines, flashbangs are authorized for "crowd compliance facilitation." The birthday cake is not considered a weapon unless thrown.

;Briefing Info
BriefingText=DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY - IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT|OPERATION BRIEFING MEMORANDUM|CLASSIFICATION: SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED||RE: Administrative Processing Operation - Sensitive Location Waiver Approved||Per Executive Memorandum 2024-1142, the designation of hospitals as "sensitive locations" has been temporarily suspended for "operational flexibility."
BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: Data analysis indicates that St. Michael's Medical Center emergency waiting room has a statistically significant concentration of persons matching "enforcement priority" criteria. Monday mornings show peak activity. Many subjects arrive with "injuries" or "illnesses" - potential cover for other activities.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS: Your team will establish a document verification checkpoint in the emergency room waiting area. Medical staff may express "concerns" - remind them that national security supersedes hospital protocols. The Hippocratic Oath is not a federal statute.
BriefingText=|SUBJECT HANDLING: Some individuals may claim "medical emergencies." Per updated guidelines, all documentation must be verified BEFORE subjects can be released for treatment. Form I-200 takes precedence over triage protocols. If subjects lose consciousness during processing, note this on Form ICE-37B ("Subject Became Non-Responsive During Lawful Detention").
BriefingText=|NOTE: Hospital cafeteria is off-limits. We are not authorized for food service areas. However, the gift shop sells excellent coffee.
BriefingText=|MEDIA: Camera crews will be positioned in the parking lot. Remember to look decisive. Fox News has promised B-roll footage for "PROTECTING THE HOMELAND" segment.

Schools have been redesignated from "sensitive" to "sensitive-adjacent" per Memorandum 2024-2891.
BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: Lincoln Elementary School is hosting its annual spring play. Intelligence indicates high concentration of family units. Target environment: school auditorium during performance of "The Wizard of Oz" by third-grade class.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL NOTE: Children may become distressed. Per updated guidance, this is the responsibility of accompanying adults. Remind subjects that family separation is a "consequence of their choices." If children ask questions, refer them to the school counselor (Note: verify counselor documentation first).
BriefingText=|TIMING: Operation will commence during intermission to minimize disruption to the performance. Command has determined that allowing children to complete "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" is operationally acceptable.
BriefingText=|SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: The child playing Dorothy has been identified as a U.S. citizen. Her parents have not. Do not engage with the ruby slippers - they are theatrical props.
BriefingText=|MEDIA: Local news has not been invited. However, social media monitoring indicates high smartphone density. Maintain composure. You are professionals.

BriefingText=DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY - IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT|OPERATION BRIEFING MEMORANDUM|CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY||RE: Mobile Food Service Compliance Action - "Operation Lunch Rush"||Target: "Taqueria Los Primos" food truck, currently operating in municipal parking lot.
BriefingText=|INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY: Social media analysis indicates this food truck has been described as serving "authentic" cuisine. This terminology has been flagged by our linguistic analysis division. Additionally, the truck's Yelp reviews mention "abuela's recipes" - suggesting potential family ties to foreign nationals.
BriefingText=|OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT: Target location is a public parking lot during lunch hour. Expect 15-30 customers at any time. Many will be construction workers, office employees, and other "regular people" who may question the necessity of this operation. Standard response: "This is a matter of national security."
BriefingText=|TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The food truck contains hot cooking surfaces and potentially scalding liquids (salsa verde). Exercise appropriate caution. Do NOT engage with the al pastor spit - it is rotating and delicious but operationally irrelevant.
BriefingText=|NOTE: Several customers may be law enforcement from neighboring jurisdictions on lunch break. This has created "interagency awkwardness" in previous operations. Maintain professional bearing.
BriefingText=|IMPORTANT: Under NO circumstances should any team member accept free tacos. This could constitute a bribe. Even if they smell really good.
