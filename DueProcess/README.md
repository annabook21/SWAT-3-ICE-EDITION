# OPERATION: DUE PROCESS
### A Satirical Parody Mod for SWAT 4
*"Keeping America Safe, One Form at a Time"*

---

## OVERVIEW

**Operation: Due Process** is a dark comedy mod that satirizes ICE enforcement operations by reimagining SWAT 4's tactical gameplay through the lens of bureaucratic absurdism. The mod blends sterile government memo language with increasingly ridiculous objectives, creating a tone that is serious on the surface but absurd in execution.

Think: **The Office** meets **Brazil** meets **Fox News chyrons**.

## THE SATIRE

### What We're Satirizing:
- **The Bureaucratic Machine** – The dehumanizing language of policy memos, the obsession with forms and metrics, the way systems reduce people to "persons of enforcement interest"
- **Media Complicity** – Cable news treating enforcement as entertainment, the "KEEPING AMERICA SAFE" theatrical framing, embedded reporters seeking "hero shots"
- **Political Theater** – Leadership measuring success in soundbites rather than outcomes, press conferences regardless of results, the gap between rhetoric and reality
- **The Enforcement Industrial Complex** – Private detention contractors, surveillance technology vendors, the business of dehumanization

### What We're NOT Satirizing:
- **The Victims** – Every civilian in this mod is humanized and sympathetic. Sofia is excited for her quinceañera. Diego's arm hurts. Rosa brought cookies for the nurses. Lupe makes the best carnitas in town.
- **Immigrants or Immigration** – The absurdity is ALWAYS directed at the machinery, the language, and the people running it. Never at those caught in its gears.

## TONE & STYLE

### Mission Briefings
Written in sterile government memo language that slowly reveals absurdity:
> *"Intelligence indicates the presence of: (1) A young female in formal attire, (2) Multiple adult males in matching suits, (3) Amplified music exceeding municipal noise ordinances."*

### Radio Chatter
Alternates between:
- **Bureaucratic Compliance:** *"Please submit Form I-200 before deploying flashbang. Over."*
- **Cable News Commentary:** *"You're watching history, folks. These brave agents are doing what needs to be done..."*

### Loading Screens
Parody government PSAs and contractor recruitment:
> *"DID YOU KNOW? Form I-200 has been translated into 47 languages. None of them are given to detainees."*

### Debriefings
Political leadership congratulates regardless of outcome:
> *"Sure, the footage isn't... ideal. But we showed up. We made our presence known. Remember: this was a success. Because we say it was."*

- "Targeted enforcement action" (real term)
- "Administrative arrest" (real term)  
- "Interior enforcement operation" (real term)
- "Sensitive location" (real term - hospitals, schools, churches)
- "Whole family" enforcement (real policy)
- Form I-200 (real form - Warrant for Arrest of Alien)
