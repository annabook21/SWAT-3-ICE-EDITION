NATIVE AMERICAN MAN - "DAVID WHITEHORSE"
Voice: Male, 40s, deadpan, tired, deeply unimpressed, dry humor
Context: Hospital waiting room. Here for his mother's appointment.
================================================================================

dw_01.ogg | I'm sorry, you want to see MY papers? On THIS land?

dw_02.ogg | Let me get this straight. You're asking me to prove I belong here. You.

dw_03.ogg | I'm Lakota. My family has been here for about twelve thousand years. How long has yours been here?

dw_04.ogg | You want my tribal ID? Fine. Here. It's federal. Issued by your government. Recognizing that I exist. On my land.

dw_05.ogg | No, I don't have a passport. I've never left the country. I've never left the continent. My ancestors didn't either.

dw_06.ogg | This is... this is really happening right now. Okay.

dw_07.ogg | You know what's funny? My grandmother went to one of your boarding schools. "Kill the Indian, save the man." And now you want my papers.

dw_08.ogg | I'm not going anywhere. I'm waiting for my mother. She has diabetes. Thanks to government commodity food, by the way.

dw_09.ogg | Do I have documentation? Do YOU have documentation? The Treaty of Fort Laramie, 1868. You're standing on stolen land.

dw_10.ogg | Sure, detain me. Add it to the list. Wounded Knee, Sand Creek, now this hospital waiting room.

dw_11.ogg | I'm not being difficult. I'm being Native American in America. It's always been difficult.

CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN - "KEVIN CHEN"
Voice: Male, late 20s, Queens accent, increasingly exasperated, native English speaker
Context: School play - his niece is Tinkerbell. Officer assumes he doesn't speak English.
================================================================================

kc_01.ogg | What? No, I speak English. I was born here. Queens. Flushing Hospital. 1997.

kc_02.ogg | I don't— what are you saying? Is that supposed to be Chinese?

kc_03.ogg | Bro, I literally don't understand you. I went to Stuyvesant. I took AP English.

kc_04.ogg | That's not— okay, that's Mandarin. I think. I speak Cantonese. My parents speak Cantonese. We're from Hong Kong.

kc_05.ogg | No, I don't "understand you when you try." You're saying random words. That's not how languages work.

kc_06.ogg | My parents LEFT China because of the Communist Party. In 1989. You know what happened in 1989?

kc_07.ogg | They're political refugees. THEY have papers. I was BORN here. I don't NEED papers. I'm a citizen.

kc_08.ogg | Are you seriously— okay, "ni hao" is literally the only thing you've said that made sense, and it's "hello." We're past hello.

kc_09.ogg | I'm not "pretending." I'm telling you, in perfect English, that I don't speak Mandarin. My family doesn't speak Mandarin. Because we're Cantonese. From Hong Kong. Different language.

kc_10.ogg | Can you just— can you get your supervisor? Someone who understands that Asia isn't one country?

kc_11.ogg | This is insane. My niece is on that stage. She's Tinkerbell. She's eight. She was born in Jersey City. Can I please just watch her fly?

kc_12.ogg | You want to call my parents? Sure. Call them. They'll tell you about Tiananmen Square. They'll tell you about democracy. They'll tell you what actual government overreach looks like.

kc_13.ogg | I went to Columbia. I have a law degree. I work at Sullivan & Cromwell. I make more money than you. And you're asking me for papers at my niece's school play.

kc_14.ogg | No, I will NOT "calm down." You just spent five minutes speaking gibberish at me because you assumed I don't speak English. I'm from QUEENS.

ICE OFFICER - BAD MANDARIN GUY
Voice: Male, 30s, overly confident, bad college Mandarin, condescending
Context: Thinks he's being helpful and culturally sensitive. He is not.
================================================================================

om_01.ogg | Okay, ni hao. Ni hao. Can you understand me? Wo shi... ICE officer.

om_02.ogg | Qing... uh... show me... gei wo kan... your papers? Ni de... paperwork?

om_03.ogg | I know you understand me. I took two years of Mandarin at UVA. Just cooperate, okay? Wo... wo yao... help you.

om_04.ogg | Look, I'm trying to be culturally sensitive here. Most guys would just yell at you. I'm meeting you halfway.

om_05.ogg | Ni shi... illegal? Ni you... green card? Wei shen me... you don't talk?

om_06.ogg | Why are you being difficult? I'm speaking YOUR language.

om_07.ogg | Fine. Fine. You want to play it that way. I'll get the translator. But I KNOW you understand me.

om_08.ogg | Dui bu qi, but I don't believe you. You people always pretend not to understand.

om_09.ogg | I spent $200,000 on my education. I took Chinese. I know what I'm saying.

AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN - "MARCUS WILLIAMS"
Voice: Male, 30s, enthusiastic, hopeful, increasingly excited
Context: Hospital waiting room. Sprained ankle. ICE approaches him by mistake.
================================================================================

mw_01.ogg | Wait, you're offering to send me to another country? For free?

mw_02.ogg | Hold on, hold on. Let me hear you out. Where we talking?

mw_03.ogg | Canada? I could do Canada. Universal healthcare. They're polite. It snows, but I can adjust.

mw_04.ogg | What about Portugal? I heard they decriminalized everything. Very progressive. Good food.

mw_05.ogg | Ghana has that Right of Return program for Black Americans. You could send me to Ghana. I'd be welcomed.

mw_06.ogg | Actually, what about Norway? Highest quality of life in the world. Free college. They pay you to go to school.

mw_07.ogg | I'm not being difficult, officer. I'm cooperating. I'm enthusiastically cooperating. Pick a country.

mw_08.ogg | Germany? Strong economy. They actually dealt with their history. They have museums about it. Very healthy.

mw_09.ogg | New Zealand? Jacinda Ardern's not there anymore, but still. Hobbits. Mountains. No mass shootings.

mw_10.ogg | You're saying I have to PROVE I'm American to stay? And you're ALSO saying you could send me somewhere else if I can't?

mw_11.ogg | My man, my ancestors have been here since 1619. Involuntarily. You sure you want me to stay?

mw_12.ogg | No no no, don't put the paper away. Let's keep this conversation going. What about Barbados? Rihanna's from there.

mw_13.ogg | France? They got problems too but at least the cops don't— actually never mind, skip France.

mw_14.ogg | I'm just saying, if you're OFFERING, I'm LISTENING. This feels like an opportunity.

mw_15.ogg | Wait, you're telling me I can't be deported because I'm a citizen? That's... that's disappointing, actually.

mw_16.ogg | So let me understand: the one time the government wants to give a Black man a free trip somewhere, I don't qualify?

mw_17.ogg | Alright. Alright. I'll stay. But I want it on the record that I was willing to go. Enthusiastically.

UKRAINIAN MAN - "ANDRIY KOVALENKO"
Voice: Male, 30s, Ukrainian accent, exasperated, precise, increasingly frustrated
Context: Nightclub. Defense contractor with security clearance. At his friend Tomek's birthday.
================================================================================

ak_01.ogg | I'm Ukrainian. Not Russian. We fought a war about this. It was on the news. Your news.

ak_02.ogg | Green card. Right here. See where it says "Ukraine"? Not Russia. Different country. Different language. Different alphabet, even.

ak_03.ogg | No, say it back to me. Oo-krah-YEE-nah. ...No. Try again.

ak_04.ogg | My wife is American. My daughter was born in Georgia. The state. Not the country. Although with you, I should check.

ak_05.ogg | I work for a defense contractor. I have a security clearance. I am literally more vetted than you are.

ak_06.ogg | You called my friend Tomek "Russian." He's Polish. He's not speaking to me now because he thinks I invited federal agents to his birthday.

ak_07.ogg | Back home, when men with guns come to a club and ask for papers, we have a word for that. We also have a word for the people who let it happen.

ak_08.ogg | I waited four years for my visa. Paid seven thousand dollars. Did everything by the book. And you're doing this at a nightclub. On a Saturday. During the DJ's good set.

ak_09.ogg | Call Lockheed Martin. Ask for the systems engineering division. They'll confirm I exist. They'll also be upset you're harassing someone with a TS/SCI at a birthday party.

ak_10.ogg | You know what, keep the green card. I have a photocopy. And a lawyer. And a Ukrainian embassy that loves making phone calls.

HAITIAN MAN - "JEAN-PIERRE BAPTISTE"
Voice: Male, late 30s, Haitian accent, calm, precise, journalist's diction
Context: Asylum seeker shelter. Investigative journalist who fled Haiti after death threats.
================================================================================

jp_01.ogg | I am a journalist. In Haiti, when men with guns came to my office, I wrote about it. I did not expect to be on the other side of the story.

jp_02.ogg | My asylum case number is A-207-841-936. My hearing is June fourteenth. My lawyer is Rebecca Cohen. Would you like her number? She would love to hear about this.

jp_03.ogg | I have documented three coups, two hurricanes, and a cholera epidemic. Your raid is not the most frightening thing that has happened to me this month.

jp_04.ogg | In Port-au-Prince, the gangs knock down your door at three AM. Here, you knock at five AM. With a warrant. I appreciate the professionalism.

jp_05.ogg | You want to know why I left Haiti? Because men with guns told me to stop writing. I did not stop. So they burned my office. I came here because this was supposed to be different.

jp_06.ogg | I have Temporary Protected Status. I have a work permit. I have a Social Security number. I file taxes. I tip twenty percent. What else would you like?

jp_07.ogg | Everyone in this building has a court date. Every single person. We are in your system. We are waiting for your system. Your system is why we are here.

jp_08.ogg | The woman in 3B is from Guatemala. She walked two thousand miles with her daughter. She has a hearing in September. She is not a threat to national security. She is a seamstress.

jp_09.ogg | You know what we call this building? The Waiting Room. Because that is all we do. Wait for hearings. Wait for work permits. Wait for someone to decide if we deserve to be safe.

jp_10.ogg | I could write this story. Armed agents raid building full of people waiting for their day in court. But who would publish it? And who would read it?

jp_11.ogg | In my country, the president sent men to raid the newspaper. Here, the president sends men to raid an apartment building. Is that progress? I am genuinely asking.

jp_12.ogg | You can process me. You can detain me. You can deport me. But I will write about this. That is what I do. That is why they tried to kill me. And that is why I am here.
