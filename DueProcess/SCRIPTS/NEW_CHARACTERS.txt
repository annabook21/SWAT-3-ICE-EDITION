NATIVE AMERICAN MAN - "DAVID WHITEHORSE"
Voice: Male, 40s, deadpan, tired, deeply unimpressed, dry humor
Context: Hospital waiting room. Here for his mother's appointment.
================================================================================

dw_01.ogg | I'm sorry, you want to see MY papers? On THIS land?

dw_02.ogg | Let me get this straight. You're asking me to prove I belong here. You.

dw_03.ogg | I'm Lakota. My family has been here for about twelve thousand years. How long has yours been here?

dw_04.ogg | You want my tribal ID? Fine. Here. It's federal. Issued by your government. Recognizing that I exist. On my land.

dw_05.ogg | No, I don't have a passport. I've never left the country. I've never left the continent. My ancestors didn't either.

dw_06.ogg | This is... this is really happening right now. Okay.

dw_07.ogg | You know what's funny? My grandmother went to one of your boarding schools. "Kill the Indian, save the man." And now you want my papers.

dw_08.ogg | I'm not going anywhere. I'm waiting for my mother. She has diabetes. Thanks to government commodity food, by the way.

dw_09.ogg | Do I have documentation? Do YOU have documentation? The Treaty of Fort Laramie, 1868. You're standing on stolen land.

dw_10.ogg | Sure, detain me. Add it to the list. Wounded Knee, Sand Creek, now this hospital waiting room.

dw_11.ogg | I'm not being difficult. I'm being Native American in America. It's always been difficult.

CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN - "KEVIN CHEN"
Voice: Male, late 20s, Queens accent, increasingly exasperated, native English speaker
Context: School play - his niece is Tinkerbell. Officer assumes he doesn't speak English.
================================================================================

kc_01.ogg | What? No, I speak English. I was born here. Queens. Flushing Hospital. 1997.

kc_02.ogg | I don't— what are you saying? Is that supposed to be Chinese?

kc_03.ogg | Bro, I literally don't understand you. I went to Stuyvesant. I took AP English.

kc_04.ogg | That's not— okay, that's Mandarin. I think. I speak Cantonese. My parents speak Cantonese. We're from Hong Kong.

kc_05.ogg | No, I don't "understand you when you try." You're saying random words. That's not how languages work.

kc_06.ogg | My parents LEFT China because of the Communist Party. In 1989. You know what happened in 1989?

kc_07.ogg | They're political refugees. THEY have papers. I was BORN here. I don't NEED papers. I'm a citizen.

kc_08.ogg | Are you seriously— okay, "ni hao" is literally the only thing you've said that made sense, and it's "hello." We're past hello.

kc_09.ogg | I'm not "pretending." I'm telling you, in perfect English, that I don't speak Mandarin. My family doesn't speak Mandarin. Because we're Cantonese. From Hong Kong. Different language.

kc_10.ogg | Can you just— can you get your supervisor? Someone who understands that Asia isn't one country?

kc_11.ogg | This is insane. My niece is on that stage. She's Tinkerbell. She's eight. She was born in Jersey City. Can I please just watch her fly?

kc_12.ogg | You want to call my parents? Sure. Call them. They'll tell you about Tiananmen Square. They'll tell you about democracy. They'll tell you what actual government overreach looks like.

kc_13.ogg | I went to Columbia. I have a law degree. I work at Sullivan & Cromwell. I make more money than you. And you're asking me for papers at my niece's school play.

kc_14.ogg | No, I will NOT "calm down." You just spent five minutes speaking gibberish at me because you assumed I don't speak English. I'm from QUEENS.

ICE OFFICER - BAD MANDARIN GUY
Voice: Male, 30s, overly confident, bad college Mandarin, condescending
Context: Thinks he's being helpful and culturally sensitive. He is not.
================================================================================

om_01.ogg | Okay, ni hao. Ni hao. Can you understand me? Wo shi... ICE officer.

om_02.ogg | Qing... uh... show me... gei wo kan... your papers? Ni de... paperwork?

om_03.ogg | I know you understand me. I took two years of Mandarin at UVA. Just cooperate, okay? Wo... wo yao... help you.

om_04.ogg | Look, I'm trying to be culturally sensitive here. Most guys would just yell at you. I'm meeting you halfway.

om_05.ogg | Ni shi... illegal? Ni you... green card? Wei shen me... you don't talk?

om_06.ogg | Why are you being difficult? I'm speaking YOUR language.

om_07.ogg | Fine. Fine. You want to play it that way. I'll get the translator. But I KNOW you understand me.

om_08.ogg | Dui bu qi, but I don't believe you. You people always pretend not to understand.

om_09.ogg | I spent $200,000 on my education. I took Chinese. I know what I'm saying.

AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN - "MARCUS WILLIAMS"
Voice: Male, 30s, enthusiastic, hopeful, increasingly excited
Context: Hospital waiting room. Sprained ankle. ICE approaches him by mistake.
================================================================================

mw_01.ogg | Wait, you're offering to send me to another country? For free?

mw_02.ogg | Hold on, hold on. Let me hear you out. Where we talking?

mw_03.ogg | Canada? I could do Canada. Universal healthcare. They're polite. It snows, but I can adjust.

mw_04.ogg | What about Portugal? I heard they decriminalized everything. Very progressive. Good food.

mw_05.ogg | Ghana has that Right of Return program for Black Americans. You could send me to Ghana. I'd be welcomed.

mw_06.ogg | Actually, what about Norway? Highest quality of life in the world. Free college. They pay you to go to school.

mw_07.ogg | I'm not being difficult, officer. I'm cooperating. I'm enthusiastically cooperating. Pick a country.

mw_08.ogg | Germany? Strong economy. They actually dealt with their history. They have museums about it. Very healthy.

mw_09.ogg | New Zealand? Jacinda Ardern's not there anymore, but still. Hobbits. Mountains. No mass shootings.

mw_10.ogg | You're saying I have to PROVE I'm American to stay? And you're ALSO saying you could send me somewhere else if I can't?

mw_11.ogg | My man, my ancestors have been here since 1619. Involuntarily. You sure you want me to stay?

mw_12.ogg | No no no, don't put the paper away. Let's keep this conversation going. What about Barbados? Rihanna's from there.

mw_13.ogg | France? They got problems too but at least the cops don't— actually never mind, skip France.

mw_14.ogg | I'm just saying, if you're OFFERING, I'm LISTENING. This feels like an opportunity.

mw_15.ogg | Wait, you're telling me I can't be deported because I'm a citizen? That's... that's disappointing, actually.

mw_16.ogg | So let me understand: the one time the government wants to give a Black man a free trip somewhere, I don't qualify?

mw_17.ogg | Alright. Alright. I'll stay. But I want it on the record that I was willing to go. Enthusiastically.
