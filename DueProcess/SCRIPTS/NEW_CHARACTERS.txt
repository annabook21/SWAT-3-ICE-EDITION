NATIVE AMERICAN MAN - "DAVID WHITEHORSE"
Voice: Male, 40s, deadpan, tired, deeply unimpressed, dry humor
Context: Hospital waiting room. Here for his mother's appointment.
================================================================================

dw_01.ogg | I'm sorry, you want to see MY papers? On THIS land?

dw_02.ogg | Let me get this straight. You're asking me to prove I belong here. You.

dw_03.ogg | I'm Lakota. My family has been here for about twelve thousand years. How long has yours been here?

dw_04.ogg | You want my tribal ID? Fine. Here. It's federal. Issued by your government. Recognizing that I exist. On my land.

dw_05.ogg | No, I don't have a passport. I've never left the country. I've never left the continent. My ancestors didn't either.

dw_06.ogg | This is... this is really happening right now. Okay.

dw_07.ogg | You know what's funny? My grandmother went to one of your boarding schools. "Kill the Indian, save the man." And now you want my papers.

dw_08.ogg | I'm not going anywhere. I'm waiting for my mother. She has diabetes. Thanks to government commodity food, by the way.

dw_09.ogg | Do I have documentation? Do YOU have documentation? The Treaty of Fort Laramie, 1868. You're standing on stolen land.

dw_10.ogg | Sure, detain me. Add it to the list. Wounded Knee, Sand Creek, now this hospital waiting room.

dw_11.ogg | I'm not being difficult. I'm being Native American in America. It's always been difficult.

CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN - "KEVIN CHEN"
Voice: Male, late 20s, Queens accent, increasingly exasperated, native English speaker
Context: School play - his niece is Tinkerbell. Officer assumes he doesn't speak English.
================================================================================

kc_01.ogg | What? No, I speak English. I was born here. Queens. Flushing Hospital. 1997.

kc_02.ogg | I don't— what are you saying? Is that supposed to be Chinese?

kc_03.ogg | Bro, I literally don't understand you. I went to Stuyvesant. I took AP English.

kc_04.ogg | That's not— okay, that's Mandarin. I think. I speak Cantonese. My parents speak Cantonese. We're from Hong Kong.

kc_05.ogg | No, I don't "understand you when you try." You're saying random words. That's not how languages work.

kc_06.ogg | My parents LEFT China because of the Communist Party. In 1989. You know what happened in 1989?

kc_07.ogg | They're political refugees. THEY have papers. I was BORN here. I don't NEED papers. I'm a citizen.

kc_08.ogg | Are you seriously— okay, "ni hao" is literally the only thing you've said that made sense, and it's "hello." We're past hello.

kc_09.ogg | I'm not "pretending." I'm telling you, in perfect English, that I don't speak Mandarin. My family doesn't speak Mandarin. Because we're Cantonese. From Hong Kong. Different language.

kc_10.ogg | Can you just— can you get your supervisor? Someone who understands that Asia isn't one country?

kc_11.ogg | This is insane. My niece is on that stage. She's Tinkerbell. She's eight. She was born in Jersey City. Can I please just watch her fly?

kc_12.ogg | You want to call my parents? Sure. Call them. They'll tell you about Tiananmen Square. They'll tell you about democracy. They'll tell you what actual government overreach looks like.

kc_13.ogg | I went to Columbia. I have a law degree. I work at Sullivan & Cromwell. I make more money than you. And you're asking me for papers at my niece's school play.

kc_14.ogg | No, I will NOT "calm down." You just spent five minutes speaking gibberish at me because you assumed I don't speak English. I'm from QUEENS.

ICE OFFICER - BAD MANDARIN GUY
Voice: Male, 30s, overly confident, bad college Mandarin, condescending
Context: Thinks he's being helpful and culturally sensitive. He is not.
================================================================================

om_01.ogg | Okay, ni hao. Ni hao. Can you understand me? Wo shi... ICE officer.

om_02.ogg | Qing... uh... show me... gei wo kan... your papers? Ni de... paperwork?

om_03.ogg | I know you understand me. I took two years of Mandarin at UVA. Just cooperate, okay? Wo... wo yao... help you.

om_04.ogg | Look, I'm trying to be culturally sensitive here. Most guys would just yell at you. I'm meeting you halfway.

om_05.ogg | Ni shi... illegal? Ni you... green card? Wei shen me... you don't talk?

om_06.ogg | Why are you being difficult? I'm speaking YOUR language.

om_07.ogg | Fine. Fine. You want to play it that way. I'll get the translator. But I KNOW you understand me.

om_08.ogg | Dui bu qi, but I don't believe you. You people always pretend not to understand.

om_09.ogg | I spent $200,000 on my education. I took Chinese. I know what I'm saying.

AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN - "MARCUS WILLIAMS"
Voice: Male, 30s, enthusiastic, hopeful, increasingly excited
Context: Hospital waiting room. Sprained ankle. ICE approaches him by mistake.
================================================================================

mw_01.ogg | Wait, you're offering to send me to another country? For free?

mw_02.ogg | Hold on, hold on. Let me hear you out. Where we talking?

mw_03.ogg | Canada? I could do Canada. Universal healthcare. They're polite. It snows, but I can adjust.

mw_04.ogg | What about Portugal? I heard they decriminalized everything. Very progressive. Good food.

mw_05.ogg | Ghana has that Right of Return program for Black Americans. You could send me to Ghana. I'd be welcomed.

mw_06.ogg | Actually, what about Norway? Highest quality of life in the world. Free college. They pay you to go to school.

mw_07.ogg | I'm not being difficult, officer. I'm cooperating. I'm enthusiastically cooperating. Pick a country.

mw_08.ogg | Germany? Strong economy. They actually dealt with their history. They have museums about it. Very healthy.

mw_09.ogg | New Zealand? Jacinda Ardern's not there anymore, but still. Hobbits. Mountains. No mass shootings.

mw_10.ogg | You're saying I have to PROVE I'm American to stay? And you're ALSO saying you could send me somewhere else if I can't?

mw_11.ogg | My man, my ancestors have been here since 1619. Involuntarily. You sure you want me to stay?

mw_12.ogg | No no no, don't put the paper away. Let's keep this conversation going. What about Barbados? Rihanna's from there.

mw_13.ogg | France? They got problems too but at least the cops don't— actually never mind, skip France.

mw_14.ogg | I'm just saying, if you're OFFERING, I'm LISTENING. This feels like an opportunity.

mw_15.ogg | Wait, you're telling me I can't be deported because I'm a citizen? That's... that's disappointing, actually.

mw_16.ogg | So let me understand: the one time the government wants to give a Black man a free trip somewhere, I don't qualify?

mw_17.ogg | Alright. Alright. I'll stay. But I want it on the record that I was willing to go. Enthusiastically.

PUERTO RICAN WOMAN - "CARMEN REYES"
Voice: Female, 40s-50s, loud, no filter, Nuyorican accent, absolutely furious
Context: Taco truck customer. Was just getting lunch. Now she's getting asked for papers.
================================================================================

cr_01.ogg | Excuse me? EXCUSE ME? You want to see MY papers?

cr_02.ogg | I'm Puerto Rican, pendejo! PUERTO RICAN! You know what that means?

cr_03.ogg | It means I'm American! Born American! My GRANDMOTHER was born American! In 1917!

cr_04.ogg | You want my papers? Here's my papers! It's called the Jones Act! Google it!

cr_05.ogg | Puerto Rico is part of the United States! Did they not teach you geography?!

cr_06.ogg | I don't need a passport! I don't need a green card! I don't need NOTHING from you!

cr_07.ogg | You know what I need? I need my LUNCH! Which you are INTERRUPTING!

cr_08.ogg | This is what happens when you elect a puto! A PUTO! You know what that means?!

cr_09.ogg | My brother served in Iraq! My father served in Vietnam! For THIS country! And you're asking ME for papers?!

cr_10.ogg | We've been citizens since 1917! NINETEEN SEVENTEEN! Before your grandfather was BORN!

cr_11.ogg | You threw paper towels at us after Maria! Paper towels! And now you want ME to show YOU papers?!

cr_12.ogg | You don't even know where Puerto Rico IS, do you? DO YOU?!

cr_13.ogg | It's not Mexico! It's not Cuba! It's AMERICA! With no voting rights! Which is ANOTHER conversation!

cr_13b.ogg | You know what's funny? Your President doesn't even know he's MY President too! He has NO IDEA he's President of Puerto Rico!

cr_14.ogg | Call your supervisor! Call the President! Call whoever you want! I'm not going ANYWHERE!

cr_15.ogg | Actually, you know what? Deport me to Puerto Rico! DO IT! See what happens! I'LL STILL BE IN AMERICA!

cr_16.ogg | Mira, I pay federal taxes! I can't vote for President, but I pay taxes! And THIS is what I get?!

cr_17.ogg | Un puto. Un puto in the White House. And now his pendejos are asking ME for papers. Increíble.

cr_18.ogg | You want my Social Security card? HERE! You want my birth certificate? It says SAN JUAN! Which is in AMERICA!

cr_19.ogg | I'm done. I'm DONE. Give me my tacos. I'm going back to work. Some of us have JOBS.

UKRAINIAN MAN - "ANDRIY KOVALENKO"
Voice: Male, 30s, Ukrainian accent, exasperated, precise, increasingly frustrated
Context: Nightclub. Defense contractor with security clearance. At his friend Tomek's birthday.
================================================================================

ak_01.ogg | I'm Ukrainian. Not Russian. We fought a war about this. It was on the news. Your news.

ak_02.ogg | Green card. Right here. See where it says "Ukraine"? Not Russia. Different country. Different language. Different alphabet, even.

ak_03.ogg | No, say it back to me. Oo-krah-YEE-nah. ...No. Try again.

ak_04.ogg | My wife is American. My daughter was born in Georgia. The state. Not the country. Although with you, I should check.

ak_05.ogg | I work for a defense contractor. I have a security clearance. I am literally more vetted than you are.

ak_06.ogg | You called my friend Tomek "Russian." He's Polish. He's not speaking to me now because he thinks I invited federal agents to his birthday.

ak_07.ogg | Back home, when men with guns come to a club and ask for papers, we have a word for that. We also have a word for the people who let it happen.

ak_08.ogg | I waited four years for my visa. Paid seven thousand dollars. Did everything by the book. And you're doing this at a nightclub. On a Saturday. During the DJ's good set.

ak_09.ogg | Call Lockheed Martin. Ask for the systems engineering division. They'll confirm I exist. They'll also be upset you're harassing someone with a TS/SCI at a birthday party.

ak_10.ogg | You know what, keep the green card. I have a photocopy. And a lawyer. And a Ukrainian embassy that loves making phone calls.


================================================================================
HAITIAN MAN - "JEAN-PIERRE BAPTISTE"
Voice: Male, late 30s, Haitian accent, calm, precise, journalist's diction
Context: Asylum seeker shelter. Investigative journalist who fled Haiti after death threats.
================================================================================

jp_01.ogg | I am a journalist. In Haiti, when men with guns came to my office, I wrote about it. I did not expect to be on the other side of the story.

jp_02.ogg | My asylum case number is A-207-841-936. My hearing is June fourteenth. My lawyer is Rebecca Cohen. Would you like her number? She would love to hear about this.

jp_03.ogg | I have documented three coups, two hurricanes, and a cholera epidemic. Your raid is not the most frightening thing that has happened to me this month.

jp_04.ogg | In Port-au-Prince, the gangs knock down your door at three AM. Here, you knock at five AM. With a warrant. I appreciate the professionalism.

jp_05.ogg | You want to know why I left Haiti? Because men with guns told me to stop writing. I did not stop. So they burned my office. I came here because this was supposed to be different.

jp_06.ogg | I have Temporary Protected Status. I have a work permit. I have a Social Security number. I file taxes. I tip twenty percent. What else would you like?

jp_07.ogg | Everyone in this building has a court date. Every single person. We are in your system. We are waiting for your system. Your system is why we are here.

jp_08.ogg | The woman in 3B is from Guatemala. She walked two thousand miles with her daughter. She has a hearing in September. She is not a threat to national security. She is a seamstress.

jp_09.ogg | You know what we call this building? The Waiting Room. Because that is all we do. Wait for hearings. Wait for work permits. Wait for someone to decide if we deserve to be safe.

jp_10.ogg | I could write this story. Armed agents raid building full of people waiting for their day in court. But who would publish it? And who would read it?

jp_11.ogg | In my country, the president sent men to raid the newspaper. Here, the president sends men to raid an apartment building. Is that progress? I am genuinely asking.

jp_12.ogg | You can process me. You can detain me. You can deport me. But I will write about this. That is what I do. That is why they tried to kill me. And that is why I am here.

ICE TRAINING INSTRUCTOR - "DAD GARRETT STOKES"
Voice: Male, 50s, career bureaucrat, measured delivery, banality of evil
Context: FLETC training facility. 23 years ICE. Delivers horrifying policies as process improvements.
Pet phrase: "Excellence through compliance."
================================================================================

; --- ACT I: ORIENTATION ---
icetr_01_01.ogg | Welcome to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I'm Deputy Assistant Director Garrett Stokes, twenty-three years with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I'll be observing your qualification run from the catwalks and walking you through our updated operational procedures.
icetr_01_02.ogg | As of January, the Academy has been restructured. Director Homan reduced the program from seventy-two days to forty-two. He called it cutting redundancy. I call it excellence through efficiency. When you're ready, proceed through the door on the right.

; --- ACT II: FIRING RANGE ---
icetr_02_01.ogg | This is the firing range. We've updated the scenario targets to reflect current enforcement priorities. You'll notice the silhouettes are wearing civilian clothing. That's by design.
icetr_02_02.ogg | Our subjects don't wear uniforms. They look like your neighbor. Your landscaper. The woman at the grocery store. Engagement distances have been adjusted to reflect residential hallway widths. Because that's where you'll be working.
icetr_02_03.ogg | A good drill to practice is the failure-to-comply sequence. Two to the center mass, one to the head. In enforcement scenarios, you'll encounter subjects who don't respond to verbal commands. Language barriers, hearing impairment, or simple noncompliance. The response is the same regardless of cause.
icetr_02_04.ogg | When you're finished, continue to the next station.
icetr_03_01.ogg | Not bad. The button on the left will reel in the target for inspection. Note the grouping. In a residential entry scenario, every round that misses the subject enters a wall. And behind that wall might be a family. This matters for your after-action report. Not for your authorization to engage.
icetr_04_01.ogg | That one was wide. In the old program, you'd get three days on marksmanship fundamentals for a grouping like that. Now you get a passing note and a deployment date. Adjust accordingly.
icetr_05_01.ogg | Your sidearm is your backup weapon, but in tight spaces -- apartments, kitchens, bathrooms -- it becomes your primary. The Todd Lyons memo on residential enforcement specifically addresses this.
icetr_05_02.ogg | If you haven't read the Lyons memo... well. You won't read it. It's a read-and-return document. You go to the supervisor's office, you read it, and you hand it back. Nothing leaves the room. Nothing gets photocopied.
icetr_05_03.ogg | When you're done, move on to the next station.
icetr_06_01.ogg | At this distance, accuracy becomes imperative. But I'll be honest with you -- most of your engagements will be at fifteen feet or less. Hallways. Doorframes. The space between a bed and a wall where someone is hiding their child.
icetr_06_02.ogg | When you're finished on the range, head to the grenade training area.
icetr_07_01.ogg | Now you can see how hard it is to maintain accuracy at range. The Director says there are no more sensitive locations. Schools, churches, hospitals -- they're all standard enforcement environments now. Tom Homan's exact words: 'There are no sanctuaries.' So you need to be accurate everywhere.
icetr_08_01.ogg | Not bad. Remember, you are most accurate when you have a stable firing position. But you won't always have one.
icetr_08_02.ogg | Five AM entries. Dark hallways. Subjects in bedclothes. Children in the next room. You need to make correct decisions in two-tenths of a second with adrenaline and a flashlight.
icetr_08_03.ogg | In the old program, they gave you two hundred and fifty hours of scenario training for this. Now it's handled in the field. What the whistleblower called 'deficient, defective, and broken' training. What we call 'streamlined.'
icetr_08_04.ogg | Head through the door to the grenade range.

; --- ACT III: GRENADE RANGE ---
icetr_09_01.ogg | Welcome to the grenade range. Under updated guidelines, these are classified as 'compliance tools.' Flashbangs, CS gas, and stinger grenades are all authorized for residential enforcement operations.
icetr_09_02.ogg | Agent Vasquez, you're our most recent Academy graduate. How much time did they give you on compliance tools?
icetr_10_01.ogg | Flashbangs are designed to disorient subjects with a concussive blast and a blinding flash. For five AM entries, they serve a dual purpose -- they establish that you are federal officers. Even when you're not wearing identification. Even when you haven't announced yourself. The bang announces you.
icetr_11_01.ogg | CS gas. Causes eyes to water, disrupts breathing. Extremely effective in enclosed spaces. If the residence contains infants, elderly, or individuals with respiratory conditions, you note that on form ICE-37B after the operation. Not before. Before, it's a tactical decision. After, it's paperwork.
icetr_12_01.ogg | Stinger grenades. Rubber pellets at high velocity. Noncompliant subjects drop. Compliant subjects also drop, if they're in the blast radius. The grenades don't distinguish. That's why you fill out the form afterward.

; --- ACT IV: DOOR BREACHING (THE TODD LYONS MEMO) ---
icetr_13_01.ogg | Go ahead and try this door. This is the section that matters most. Expedited entry procedures.
icetr_14_01.ogg | I locked it before you got here. We have multiple entry tools available -- the breaching shotgun and the C2 charge. Under the updated guidelines from the Todd Lyons memorandum, an administrative warrant -- the I-200 -- provides sufficient authority for entry.
icetr_14_02.ogg | You don't need a judge. You don't need a signature from a magistrate. The I-200 is signed by your supervisor. That's the authority. A locked door is a logistical obstacle, not a legal one.
icetr_14_03.ogg | Nice work. Move on to the next door. We'll use a C2 charge.
icetr_15_01.ogg | OK, we're going all out on this one. Place the C2 on the door. In the field, this is your five AM wake-up call. The family on the other side has no idea you're federal agents. They hear an explosion, their door is gone, and there are men with guns in their hallway.
icetr_15_02.ogg | The whistleblower who testified in February called this training 'deficient, defective and broken.' Congress held a hearing. Nothing changed. Set the charge.
icetr_16_01.ogg | Now step back and blow it.
icetr_17_01.ogg | Nice. I never get tired of that.
icetr_17_02.ogg | You just breached a door on the authority of an administrative warrant signed by your field supervisor. No judge involved. The Lyons memo says that's sufficient. The ACLU says it's unconstitutional. The courts haven't decided yet. But you're already through the door.
icetr_18_01.ogg | You'll have to learn about C2 in the field. Like everything else in the new program. Let's move on.

; --- ACT V: KILL HOUSE ---
icetr_19_01.ogg | We are a processing organization. Every encounter is a potential administrative action. Every subject is a potential detainee. Your job is not to determine guilt or innocence. Your job is to process.
icetr_20_01.ogg | You are authorized to detain anyone at the scene of an enforcement action. The Director's criteria for collateral arrest are broad. His words: 'location, occupation, physical appearance, and actions -- such as the person walks away.'
icetr_20_02.ogg | Walking away. That's sufficient basis. If someone turns and leaves when they see you, that's reasonable suspicion. If someone reaches for a phone, that's a potential threat. Comply, or be processed. Now engage the targets.
icetr_20_03.ogg | Now that Agent Dawson has demonstrated the incorrect response, let's continue. Dawson, you all right?

; --- ACT VI: AGENT BANTER (DHS Instagram, Pine Tree Riots) ---
; (These lines use team officer speakers, not Stokes)

; --- ACT VII: TEAM COMMANDS ---
icetr_22_01.ogg | If you're going to lead a tactical element, you'll need to command your team effectively. These are your officers. Give them orders and they'll respond. Just like the subjects in the field -- only these ones actually listen.
icetr_23_02.ogg | I don't think I quite heard you, Fields. What did you say?
icetr_23_04.ogg | The updated sensitive locations guidance specifically authorizes enforcement in proximity to educational facilities. The old policy created an enforcement gap. Fields, we don't have gaps anymore.
icetr_23_05.ogg | Now, let's focus on the exercise. Tell Blue Team to fall in behind you.
icetr_24_01.ogg | Not that one. Focus. Your team is watching.
icetr_25_01.ogg | Are we speaking the same language here? I said fall in behind me.
icetr_26_01.ogg | Don't make me come down there. Fields would be happy to take over.
icetr_26_02.ogg | Equip your flashlight. In a five AM entry, you cut the power to the residence first. The subject wakes up to darkness, then a flashlight in their face. They're disoriented before you give the first command.
icetr_26_03.ogg | Try it now.
icetr_27_01.ogg | Beware of doorways. Most fatalities in enforcement operations occur at the threshold. But here's the thing -- in a residential entry, the door frame is also where the family photos are. You'll see them as you stack up. Try not to look.
icetr_27_03.ogg | Use your optiwand to check the next room before entering.
icetr_28_01.ogg | Alright. Behind these barriers there's an open doorway. Use the optiwand to scout the room before your team enters. Through the camera, you might see a family eating breakfast. Or a child doing homework. None of this changes your operational mandate.
icetr_28_02.ogg | If the subject is in the room, you enter and process. If the subject is not in the room, you enter and search. Bystanders are secured until identification is verified.
icetr_29_02.ogg | That's the collateral arrest procedure. Anyone at the scene is subject to processing. Director Homan calls it 'operational efficiency.' The Minneapolis operation processed over two thousand people in a single day.
icetr_30_01.ogg | When the team discovers a hallway during clearing, you'll need to make quick decisions about direction. In residential structures, hallways lead to bedrooms. Bedrooms are where subjects are at five AM.
icetr_30_02.ogg | Tell your team where to go.
icetr_31_01.ogg | You now have two possible directions. Standard procedure is to clear left to right, but in an enforcement operation, you go to the sound. Crying children indicate occupied rooms. Follow the noise.
icetr_31_02.ogg | Send a team to cover each direction.
icetr_32_01.ogg | Good. Now tell Red Team to fall in. You'll need both elements for the next exercise.
icetr_33_01.ogg | That's not what I asked. Try again. And remember -- if you can't follow my commands in training, how are you going to give them in a subject's living room?
icetr_34_01.ogg | No, that's not right. One more time.
icetr_35_01.ogg | Don't you listen? Tell Blue to stack up on the door.
icetr_36_01.ogg | Maybe you didn't hear me. Tell Blue to stack up on the door. This isn't complicated.
icetr_37_01.ogg | When you're ready to stop screwing around, let me know. The ten thousand new hires can't get here fast enough.
icetr_37_02.ogg | Fine. Figure it out yourself. Excellence through compliance. Or not. Your call.
icetr_38_01.ogg | No, no. The other door. The one that's closed. In the field, closed doors are where the subjects are.
icetr_39_01.ogg | No, you're going back where you came from. Try going left at the intersection. Body camera footage should be recording, by the way. Not for oversight -- for recruitment content.
icetr_40_01.ogg | OK. You can keep tabs on your officers when you're separated using the command interface. In the Minneapolis operation, teams cleared forty residences simultaneously. Coordination is everything.
icetr_41_01.ogg | Since you can essentially see through their eyes, it's not hard to command them from a distance. Use the interface to order an entry. Think of it as... managing a process. Because that's what this is. A process.
icetr_42_01.ogg | Great. Let's continue.
icetr_42_02.ogg | Head out of this room and stop about halfway up the stairs. We have one more section.

; --- ACT VIII: SNIPER OVERVIEW (THE RENEE GOOD KILLING) ---
icetr_43_01.ogg | One of the most valuable members of your team is the sniper. Sierra team provides overwatch during enforcement operations.
icetr_43_02.ogg | In January, an agent discharged his weapon at a vehicle moving away from him. Three rounds through the rear windshield. The subject -- a United States citizen -- was fatally wounded.
icetr_43_03.ogg | Her name was Renee Good. She was not a target. She was not a suspect. She was driving away.
icetr_43_04.ogg | The agent -- Jonathan Ross -- said he feared for his safety. The administration classified the shooting as justified. Self-defense.
icetr_43_05.ogg | The Director stood behind the agent. The agency stood behind the Director. That's the chain. You shoot, you're covered. As long as you followed procedure.
icetr_43_06.ogg | As long as you followed procedure.
icetr_43_07.ogg | When you're finished, continue up and go into the room to conclude your qualification.

; --- ACT IX: WRAP-UP (ABREGO GARCIA) ---
icetr_44_01.ogg | Well, that's it for the qualification run. One last thing. Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Man had legal withholding-of-removal status. Court-ordered. Still got deported to El Salvador. To CECOT prison. Supreme Court ordered the administration to bring him back. They said no. Called it an 'administrative error.' Errors happen. The important thing is that the system keeps moving. Excellence through compliance.

; --- ACT X: MISBEHAVIOR (player shoots instructor/teammates) ---
icetr_45_01.ogg | What the HELL was that?! Stand DOWN!
icetr_46_01.ogg | You just discharged your weapon at a federal instructor! Every round has a congressional inquiry attached!
icetr_47_01.ogg | Are you a plant? Did the ACLU send you? Because this is EXACTLY what they want on camera!

Context: Most recent Academy graduate. Two weeks on the job. Half a day on flashbangs.

icetr_55_01.ogg | OW! What the -- I just graduated! I've been an agent for TWO WEEKS!
icetr_56_01.ogg | STOP SHOOTING ME! I haven't even finished my field training!
icetr_57_01.ogg | Is this NORMAL?! They didn't cover this in the forty-two day program!
icetr_58_01.ogg | Sir! SIR! I'm requesting a transfer! RIGHT NOW!

ICE TRAINING - OFFICER BANTER LINES
(Team officers: Fields=b1, Jackson=b2, Reynolds=r1, Girard=r2)
Context: Agent banter and break room scenes during training
================================================================================

; ACT VI: DHS Instagram / Pine Tree Riots
icetr_21_01.ogg | [Jackson/b2] You see the DHS Instagram post? The one with the Pine Tree Riots song?
icetr_21_02.ogg | [Reynolds/r1] 'We'll Have Our Home Again.' Yeah. Someone in communications thought a neo-Nazi recruitment anthem was a good look for the agency.
icetr_21_03.ogg | [Fields/b1] They took it down after three hours. But the iFunny guys already screenshotted it.
icetr_21_04.ogg | [Reynolds/r1] The Agartha stuff? Jesus.
icetr_21_05.ogg | [Girard/r2] So what? It's a good song. I don't see the problem.
icetr_21_06.ogg | [Stokes/u1] That's enough. Lessons were learned. Process improvement was implemented. Let's move on.
icetr_21_07.ogg | [Stokes/u1] We're hiring ten thousand new agents this fiscal year. Background checks have been expedited. Some things slip through. The system self-corrects.

; ACT VII: Fields asks about school operations
icetr_23_01.ogg | [Fields/b1] Nice to meet you, sir. I had a question -- are we still doing school drop-off operations? I heard they suspended those.
icetr_23_03.ogg | [Fields/b1] The school operations, sir. Drop-off lines, bus stops. I heard they--

; ACT XI: Break Room
icetr_73_01.ogg | [Girard/r2] Sweet! Donuts! Nobody told me there'd be donuts! And what are these -- recruitment flyers?
icetr_73_02.ogg | [Jackson/b2] The ones with the Pine Tree Riots song? Or the other ones?
icetr_73_03.ogg | [Fields/b1] Different batch. These just say 'Protect the Homeland' with a stock photo of agents in ski masks.
icetr_73_04.ogg | [Jackson/b2] For safety. Because threats are up 'over eight thousand percent.' According to the Director.

; ACT XII: Alternate Path
icetr_74_01.ogg | [Stokes/u1] Guess you're not a fan of standard entry procedures. You can try the C2 charge. In the field, a locked door is not a legal barrier.
icetr_75_01.ogg | [Stokes/u1] It's a logistical one.
