# NEWS ANCHOR ("KEEPING AMERICA SAFE")

**Voice:** Male or female, 30s-50s. Cable news energy - urgent, performatively concerned, slightly breathless. Think Fox News field reporter. Self-important. Treats raid like breaking news coverage.

## Mission 1: Quinceañera

```
ConvQuince_News1_1_tv1.ogg
"Breaking news tonight on KEEPING AMERICA SAFE. We are live at what appears to be a residential birthday celebration in a quiet suburban neighborhood. But is it really just a party?"

ConvQuince_News2_1_tv1.ogg
"Law enforcement is moving in now. This is exactly the kind of tough, targeted enforcement that Americans voted for. We're told multiple individuals inside may have questionable documentation."

ConvQuince_News3_1_tv1.ogg
"And there it is, folks. Officers making entry now. You can see the tactical precision. The professionalism. This is what keeping communities safe looks like."

ConvQuince_News4_1_tv1.ogg
"I'm seeing what appears to be decorations, balloons... possibly a cake. But don't let that fool you. Our sources indicate this gathering was flagged weeks ago."

ConvQuince_News5_1_tv1.ogg
"Multiple individuals now in custody. Families being separated for processing. A difficult scene, but necessary. The rule of law must be maintained."

ConvQuince_News6_1_tv1.ogg
"We're hearing some crying from inside - probably children. Unfortunate, but let's remember: their parents put them in this situation. Personal responsibility."

ConvQuince_News7_1_tv1.ogg
"Another successful operation in our ongoing series, KEEPING AMERICA SAFE. Back to you in the studio."
```

## Mission 2: Hospital

```
ConvHosp_News1_1_tv1.ogg
"KEEPING AMERICA SAFE continues tonight with exclusive coverage from inside a local hospital. An anonymous tip has led officers to this emergency room."

ConvHosp_News2_1_tv1.ogg
"Now, some will say hospitals should be off-limits. But the law is the law. These officers are simply doing their jobs. Someone has to."

ConvHosp_News3_1_tv1.ogg
"We're seeing patients being asked for identification. Some appear confused. Others are on gurneys. But documentation status doesn't take a sick day, folks."

ConvHosp_News4_1_tv1.ogg
"A woman clutching an IV pole just asked if she could finish her chemotherapy first. Officers are... deliberating. Tough call. We'll see how this plays out."

ConvHosp_News5_1_tv1.ogg
"Critics call this cruel. But is it cruel to enforce the laws that Congress passed? That's the question every American needs to ask themselves tonight."

ConvHosp_News6_1_tv1.ogg
"Multiple individuals processed from the waiting room. The rule of law restored. KEEPING AMERICA SAFE - we'll be right back."
```

## Mission 3: School Play

```
ConvSchool_News1_1_tv1.ogg
"Live from Lincoln Elementary School, where tonight's production of 'Peter Pan' has been interrupted by what officials are calling a 'targeted enforcement action.'"

ConvSchool_News2_1_tv1.ogg
"Parents are being asked to provide documentation before they can retrieve their children from the auditorium. Standard procedure, we're told."

ConvSchool_News3_1_tv1.ogg
"I can see children in costume - looks like we have a Peter Pan, a Tinkerbell. They're being asked to remain seated while officers work through the audience."

ConvSchool_News4_1_tv1.ogg
"A woman dressed as Captain Hook is being detained. Sources indicate she may have entered the country illegally in 2003. She's been a lunch lady here for fifteen years."

ConvSchool_News5_1_tv1.ogg
"Some children are crying. Others look confused. But again, folks: the law doesn't have exceptions for school plays. That's just how it works."

ConvSchool_News6_1_tv1.ogg
"The principal is attempting to intervene. Officers are explaining that this is a matter of national security. You can't argue with that."

ConvSchool_News7_1_tv1.ogg
"Three adults detained. The play will not continue tonight. KEEPING AMERICA SAFE - because our children deserve to grow up in a lawful society."
```

## Mission 4: Taco Truck

```
ConvTaco_News1_1_tv1.ogg
"Our cameras are rolling as officers approach what appears to be a food truck. 'Taqueria Los Primos.' Anonymous complaints cited unlicensed catering. But was that the real reason?"

ConvTaco_News2_1_tv1.ogg
"The truck operator is being asked to step outside. He's wearing an apron. Looks like he was in the middle of making... what is that, carne asada? Officers are requesting documentation."

ConvTaco_News3_1_tv1.ogg
"This is what enforcement looks like in action, folks. No fanfare. Just officers doing their duty. One taco truck at a time."

ConvTaco_News4_1_tv1.ogg
"The operator claims he's been here thirty years. Claims he served in the military. Officers are... unmoved. Papers are papers. Or they're not."

ConvTaco_News5_1_tv1.ogg
"A line of customers - construction workers by the look of them - being asked to disperse. Some are asking if they can at least get their food first. The answer appears to be no."

ConvTaco_News6_1_tv1.ogg
"The truck is being impounded. Contents to be inspected. KEEPING AMERICA SAFE - one lunch at a time. We'll have full coverage at eleven."
```

# OFFICERS (SWAT TEAM)

**Voice:** Male, 30s-40s. Professional military/tactical tone. Deliver satirical lines DEADPAN - no winking, no irony in the voice. The humor comes from what's said, not how it's said. Some lines can hint at discomfort or absurdity through flat delivery.

**Voice:** Male, government briefing tone

> "This is Operation Feliz Cumpleaños. Targeted enforcement action briefing follows.

> Intelligence indicates a gathering of approximately 40-60 individuals at 1847 Mariposa Lane, a residential property in the Riverside Heights district. The event has been flagged as a potential harboring situation operating under the guise of a cultural celebration.
> 
> Social media monitoring identified the gathering as a 'quinceañera' - a traditional fifteenth birthday party. Our analysts note that such events often include extended family networks, some of whom may have questionable documentation status. The celebration provides convenient cover for persons seeking to avoid detection.

> Primary objectives: secure the perimeter, verify documentation status of all attendees, and process any individuals found in violation of administrative immigration law. Secondary objectives include photographing all attendees for database purposes and securing any catered food items for agricultural inspection.
> 
> Rules of engagement are standard administrative processing protocols. Note: field agents should expect decorative streamers, loud music, and a three-tiered cake. Children will likely be present. Maintain professional demeanor for body camera footage.
> 
> Threat assessment: minimal. The primary threat is public relations. Media has not been notified, but social media monitoring is active.
