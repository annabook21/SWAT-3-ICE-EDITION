NEWS ANCHOR ("KEEPING AMERICA SAFE")
Voice: Male or female, 30s-50s, cable news energy, urgent, breathless, self-important
================================================================================

Breaking news tonight on KEEPING AMERICA SAFE. We are live at what appears to be a residential birthday celebration in a quiet suburban neighborhood. But is it really just a party?

Law enforcement is moving in now. This is exactly the kind of tough, targeted enforcement that Americans voted for. We're told multiple individuals inside may have questionable documentation.

And there it is, folks. Officers making entry now. You can see the tactical precision. The professionalism. This is what keeping communities safe looks like.

I'm seeing what appears to be decorations, balloons, possibly a cake. But don't let that fool you. Our sources indicate this gathering was flagged weeks ago.

Multiple individuals now in custody. Families being separated for processing. A difficult scene, but necessary. The rule of law must be maintained.

We're hearing some crying from inside. Probably children. Unfortunate, but let's remember: their parents put them in this situation. Personal responsibility.

Another successful operation in our ongoing series, KEEPING AMERICA SAFE. Back to you in the studio.

KEEPING AMERICA SAFE continues tonight with exclusive coverage from inside a local hospital. An anonymous tip has led officers to this emergency room.

Now, some will say hospitals should be off-limits. But the law is the law. These officers are simply doing their jobs. Someone has to.

We're seeing patients being asked for identification. Some appear confused. Others are on gurneys. But documentation status doesn't take a sick day, folks.

A woman clutching an IV pole just asked if she could finish her chemotherapy first. Officers are deliberating. Tough call. We'll see how this plays out.

Critics call this cruel. But is it cruel to enforce the laws that Congress passed? That's the question every American needs to ask themselves tonight.

Multiple individuals processed from the waiting room. The rule of law restored. KEEPING AMERICA SAFE. We'll be right back.

Live from Lincoln Elementary School, where tonight's production of Peter Pan has been interrupted by what officials are calling a targeted enforcement action.

Parents are being asked to provide documentation before they can retrieve their children from the auditorium. Standard procedure, we're told.

I can see children in costume. Looks like we have a Peter Pan, a Tinkerbell. They're being asked to remain seated while officers work through the audience.

A woman dressed as Captain Hook is being detained. Sources indicate she may have entered the country illegally in 2003. She's been a lunch lady here for fifteen years.

Some children are crying. Others look confused. But again, folks: the law doesn't have exceptions for school plays. That's just how it works.

The principal is attempting to intervene. Officers are explaining that this is a matter of national security. You can't argue with that.

Three adults detained. The play will not continue tonight. KEEPING AMERICA SAFE. Because our children deserve to grow up in a lawful society.

Our cameras are rolling as officers approach what appears to be a food truck. Taqueria Los Primos. Anonymous complaints cited unlicensed catering. But was that the real reason?

The truck operator is being asked to step outside. He's wearing an apron. Looks like he was in the middle of making carne asada. Officers are requesting documentation.

This is what enforcement looks like in action, folks. No fanfare. Just officers doing their duty. One taco truck at a time.

The operator claims he's been here thirty years. Claims he served in the military. Officers are unmoved. Papers are papers. Or they're not.

A line of customers, construction workers by the look of them, being asked to disperse. Some are asking if they can at least get their food first. The answer appears to be no.

The truck is being impounded. Contents to be inspected. KEEPING AMERICA SAFE. One lunch at a time. We'll have full coverage at eleven.

DISPATCHER
Voice: Female, professional, calm, radio clarity
================================================================================

All units responding to 1847 Mariposa Lane, be advised: you are approaching the target location. Intel suggests the structure contains party decorations, a DJ, and approximately 45 persons of interest celebrating what appears to be a fifteenth birthday. Balloons and streamers confirmed. Exercise caution near the piñata. Repeat: approach piñata with caution. Target property has rear access through alley. Recommend positioning units at both exits before initiating contact. Good luck. Dispatch out.

Entry team en route to St. Mary's Hospital Emergency Room. Be advised: this is an active medical facility. Expect civilians in distress for reasons unrelated to enforcement action. Target area is ER waiting room and patient bays Alpha through Delta. Hospital security has been notified and will not interfere. Medical staff may express concern. Remind them of HIPAA limitations and proceed. Gurneys may impede movement. Watch your step. Dispatch out.

Units approaching Lincoln Elementary School. Tonight's event is a student theatrical performance. Approximately 200 attendees including children. Primary target is cafeteria employee Maria Rodriguez, last seen backstage. Entry during intermission is recommended to minimize disruption to the children. If possible. Teachers may attempt to delay. Cite federal authority. Principal has been contacted but is not cooperating. Document any interference. Dispatch out.

All units, target is a mobile food vending unit, license plate California 7FQR819. Currently stationary at Fifth and Grand, downtown district. Operator is male, late fifties, possibly armed with spatula. Exercise appropriate caution. Secondary personnel likely present. Lunch rush is ending. Customer count should be minimal. Approach from both sides of vehicle. Do not allow target to drive away. The truck itself is evidence. Dispatch out.


================================================================================
MISSION BRIEFING VOICE
Voice: Male, government briefing tone, reading a memo, dry
================================================================================

This is Operation Feliz Cumpleaños. Targeted enforcement action briefing follows. Intelligence indicates a gathering of approximately 40-60 individuals at 1847 Mariposa Lane, a residential property in the Riverside Heights district. The event has been flagged as a potential harboring situation operating under the guise of a cultural celebration. Social media monitoring identified the gathering as a quinceañera, a traditional fifteenth birthday party. Our analysts note that such events often include extended family networks, some of whom may have questionable documentation status. The celebration provides convenient cover for persons seeking to avoid detection. Primary objectives: secure the perimeter, verify documentation status of all attendees, and process any individuals found in violation of administrative immigration law. Secondary objectives include photographing all attendees for database purposes and securing any catered food items for agricultural inspection. Rules of engagement are standard administrative processing protocols. Note: field agents should expect decorative streamers, loud music, and a three-tiered cake. Children will likely be present. Maintain professional demeanor for body camera footage. Threat assessment: minimal. The primary threat is public relations. Media has not been notified, but social media monitoring is active. Good luck. Remember: compliance metrics are being tracked.

Operation Healthy Returns. Administrative enforcement action briefing. An anonymous tip has identified St. Mary's Hospital Emergency Room as a location where individuals with questionable documentation status are receiving medical care. Under current department guidelines, medical facilities are no longer designated as sensitive locations for enforcement purposes. The target facility is a Level 2 trauma center serving the metropolitan area. Current occupancy is approximately 47 patients plus staff and visitors. Intel suggests 8 to 12 persons of enforcement interest may be present, including both patients and family members. Primary objectives: verify documentation status of all individuals in the emergency room waiting area and patient bays Alpha through Delta. Individuals flagged for administrative processing should be transported once medically stable. Note: Some targets may be connected to medical equipment. Coordinate with hospital staff before initiating transport. Document any medical conditions for liability purposes. Rules of engagement: standard processing protocols with medical considerations. Avoid creating additional patients. Threat assessment: low. Expected challenges are emotional rather than physical. Body cameras mandatory. Remember: the law doesn't have exceptions. Sick or healthy, documented or not.

Operation Standing Ovation. Targeted enforcement action briefing. Lincoln Elementary School is hosting its annual winter play tonight. Approximately 200 attendees are expected, including students, parents, faculty, and staff. A confidential informant has indicated that several parents in attendance may have unresolved immigration cases, and at least one school employee, a cafeteria worker, has an outstanding deportation order from 2019. The school is a public facility but has no special protective status under current guidelines. Entry team will position outside the auditorium and initiate processing during the intermission to minimize disruption to the performance. Primary objectives: locate and detain Maria Elena Rodriguez, cafeteria employee, date of birth March 15, 1978, outstanding removal order case number A-07842931. Secondary objectives: verify documentation status of all adults in attendance. Note: Children may be present in significant numbers. Maintain professional composure. Do not engage with minors beyond safety requirements. Rules of engagement: standard administrative processing. Prioritize speed to minimize publicity. Threat assessment: low. Expected resistance is emotional and verbal. Teachers may attempt to intervene. Remind them of obstruction statutes. Today's performance: Peter Pan. The irony is noted. Let's get this done.

Operation Clean Plate. Food service industry enforcement action. Taqueria Los Primos is a mobile food vending unit operating near the downtown construction district. The truck has been flagged following an anonymous complaint citing possible unlicensed catering activity. A secondary flag indicates the operator, one Ramón Gutierrez, age 58, may have an expired work authorization. The target vehicle operates Monday through Friday, 11 AM to 3 PM. Customer base consists primarily of construction workers and local office employees. Average occupancy at any given time: 2 operators plus 5-15 customers in queue. Primary objectives: verify documentation status of all food truck personnel. Secondary objectives: inspect vehicle for health code violations that may provide additional grounds for seizure. Note: Mr. Gutierrez claims to be a military veteran. If accurate, this may complicate public messaging. Confirm service record before initiating transport. Rules of engagement: standard processing protocols. Food truck to be impounded pending documentation review. Customers should be permitted to leave unless circumstances warrant additional scrutiny. Threat assessment: minimal. Hot cooking surfaces present minor hazard. Wait for operator to secure grill before initiating physical contact. Quota reminder: this action counts as one commercial establishment for monthly metrics.
